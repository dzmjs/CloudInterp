# CloudInterp
Interpolate satellite cloud images into smooth animations. 

**CloudInterp** is a Python tool designed to interpolate satellite cloud images and generate smooth transition animations. By processing a time series of satellite imagery, it creates continuous `.gif` or `.mp4` videos, ideal for meteorological visualization, scientific communication, or educational use.
